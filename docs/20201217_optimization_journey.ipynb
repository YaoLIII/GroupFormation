    "For example, in our case, the reference model is of degree $3$, and we obtained the best result using a polynomial of degree $3$. However, the reference model only contains the monomials $x$ and $x^3$, whereas our fit contains *all monomials up to degree* $3$, i.e., $x$, $x^2$, $x^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of requiring a maximum degree for the polynomial, we could require a maximum number of components (monomials). For example, if our reference model would contain only the odd monomials $x$, $x^3$, $x^5$, $x^7$, we could obtain a good fit using a polynomial with 4 components, but we would not achieve a good fit with a polynomial of degree 4, since this would contain $x$, $x^2$, $x^3$, $x^4$. Thus, we would include \"useless\" monomials $x^2$, $x^4$, while being unable to model the effects of $x^5$ and $x^7$.\n",
